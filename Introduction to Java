Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language.Java is known for its simplicity, robustness(robustness refers to the ability of a system, process, or model to remain effective and reliable under a variety of conditions, 
including those that are unexpected or adverse.), and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications(Enterprise-level applications refer to software systems designed to meet the needs of large organizations
or businesses, often across multiple departments, locations, or even countries).Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Java applications are compiled to byte code
that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The journey of this powerful programming language began in 1991 when James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of engineers at Sun Microsystems known as the “Green Team,” set out 
to create a new language initially called “Oak.” Oak was later renamed Java, inspired by Java coffee, and was first publicly released in 1996 as Java 1.0.

The Java compiler (javac) converts the source code into bytecode, which is stored in a .class file. This bytecode is platform-independent and can be executed on any machine with a JVM.

The JVM executes the compiled bytecode, translating it into machine code specific to the operating system and hardware.

1. Java Virtual Machine(JVM)

The JVM is an integral part of the Java platform, responsible for executing Java bytecode. It ensures that the output of Java programs is consistent across different platforms.
When we compile a .java file, .class files(contains byte-code) with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the Java compiler. 

2. Bytecode

Bytecode is the intermediate representation of Java code, generated by the Java compiler. It is platform-independent and can be executed by the JVM.


3. Java Development Kit(JDK)

It is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime.The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a cross-platformed software 
development environment that offers a collection of tools and libraries necessary for developing Java-based software applications and applets. 

JDK contains:

    Java Runtime Environment (JRE),
    An interpreter/loader (Java),
    A compiler (javac),
    An archiver (jar) and many more.

JRE
We need an environment to make a run of our program. Henceforth, JRE stands for “Java Runtime Environment” and may also be written as “Java RTE.” 
The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files. 


4. Garbage Collector

Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not referenced.


5. ClassPath

The Classpath is the file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files to load.

Java advantages are it is platform independent, object oriented, provides security(automatic memory management and typechecking), large community and enterprise level applications.

Java disadvantages are it is slower as compared to other programming languages.

Currently Java SE17

The JIT or Just-In-Time compiler is an essential part of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), that is responsible for performance optimization of java based applications during run time.



Step-by-Step Execution of Java Program

    Whenever a program is written in JAVA, the java compiles it.
    The result of the JAVA compiler is the .class file or the bytecode and not the machine’s native code (unlike the C compiler).
    The bytecode generated is a non-executable code and needs an interpreter to execute on a machine. This interpreter is the JVM 
     and thus the Bytecode is executed by the JVM.
    And finally, the program runs to give the desired output.
