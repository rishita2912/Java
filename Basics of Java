1. Class : It defines a set of properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class can have. 

 2. Object : The object is an instance of a class. It is an entity that has behavior and state.

    Example: Dog, Cat, Monkey etc. are the object of “Animal” class. 

 3. Method : The behavior of an object is the method.

    Example : The fuel indicator indicates the amount of fuel left in the car. 

 4.Instance variables : Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. The 
    state of an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.

 Compile it by typing “javac filename.java” in the terminal window.
Execute (or run) it by typing “java filename” in the terminal window. 

  
  public : So that JVM can execute the method from anywhere.
  static : The main method is to be called without an object. The modifiers are public and static can be written in either order.
  void : The main method doesn’t return anything.
  main() : Name configured in the JVM. The main method must be inside the class definition. The compiler executes the codes starting always from the main function.
  String[] : The main method accepts a single argument, i.e., an array of elements of type String.

   
  Primitive Data Type: such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double
